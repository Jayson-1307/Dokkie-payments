## What is this project

## Used Technologies
For this project I only used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I did not use a database for this project. Instead of that I used the localstorage, so that I could practice with it. 
- **Javascript**: Used for client-side logic, including interactivity and dynamic content updates. I utilized the browser's localStorage to persist data without needing a database, allowing for practice with storing, retrieving, and manipulating data directly within the browser.
- **HTML**: The standard markup language for creating and structuring content on the web.
- **CSS/[LESS](https://lesscss.org/)**: CSS styles the visual presentation, while LESS is a preprocessor that adds dynamic features like variables, nesting and mixins for easier styling management.
- **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)**
- **Node.js**: The runtime for building scalable network applications.
