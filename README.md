## What is this project
This project was the first assignment I received when I started at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. Now, in my second year, I thought back to that project and decided it would be a fun side project to revisit. My main goal was to practice using localStorage and working with JSON formats again.   

The project is a tool that helps people organize outings and track who participated and how much they spent. For each outing, users can add participants and activities that took place during the event, along with the associated costs and who paid for them. The tool tracks how much each person owes, making it easy to settle expenses when the outing is over. This helps simplify group outings with friends or family, ensuring everyone knows exactly who owes what, making the process clear and hassle-free.

## Used Technologies
For this project I only used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I did not use a database for this project. Instead of that I used the localstorage, so that I could practice with it. 
- **Javascript**: Used for client-side logic, including interactivity and dynamic content updates. I utilized the browser's localStorage to persist data without needing a database, allowing for practice with storing, retrieving, and manipulating data directly within the browser.
- **HTML**: The standard markup language for creating and structuring content on the web.
- **CSS/[LESS](https://lesscss.org/)**: CSS styles the visual presentation, while LESS is a preprocessor that adds dynamic features like variables, nesting and mixins for easier styling management.
- **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)**
- **Node.js**: The runtime for building scalable network applications.
